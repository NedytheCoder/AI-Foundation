# How I Read Machine Learning Research Papers

## Why this exists
ML papers are dense, mathematical, and often misleading if read the wrong way.  
This document captures how I train myself to extract insight, not just information.

---

## Step 1 — Abstract & Introduction
I read these to answer three questions:
- What problem are they solving?
- Why does it matter?
- What is their claimed contribution?

If I can’t answer these in simple words, I’m not ready to read the rest.

---

## Step 2 — Figures and Tables
Before equations, I look at:
- model diagrams
- graphs
- result tables

These usually reveal:
- what the model actually does
- whether the method worked
- how it compares to others

Often this already exposes weaknesses or overclaiming.

---

## Step 3 — Related Work
Here I map:
- what already existed
- what this paper changes
- whether the contribution is real or incremental

This prevents me from being impressed by small improvements.

---

## Step 4 — Method
This is the core.

I try to understand:
- what the inputs are
- what transformations happen
- what the outputs represent

I don’t aim to memorise equations — I aim to understand what is being computed and why.

---

## Step 5 — Experiments
I look for:
- dataset size and quality
- baseline models
- whether the comparison is fair

A strong method with weak experiments is not convincing.

---

## Step 6 — Conclusions & Limitations
This shows:
- what the authors believe they achieved
- what they admit does not work

The limitations are often more important than the headline results.

---

## Step 7 — References
Good papers point to:
- the real pioneers
- the mathematical foundations
- competing approaches

This is how I build a reading list.

---

## My Rules
- First read: understand the story  
- Second read: understand the method  
- Third read: judge the science  

If a paper survives all three, it’s worth deeper study.
